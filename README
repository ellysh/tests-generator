This is list of available scripts to generate tests from templates:

    autogen.sh - this script creates test from the template in directory
with the specified name (for example with name `1axx1`).

The template directory consist from four sub-directories

    1. access
    2. bug
    3. memory
    4. object

Skeleton of the test's template is consisted in the files from `bug` subdirectory.
You can see macros with `@>` symbols prefix in the files. These macros will be
substituted by variables that will be found in the `access`, `memory` and `object`
 subdirectories.

You can rename all these subdirectories. Fix it in the `autogen.sh` script.

Format of the macros names matches to Python variables naming rules and
the `@>` prefix is also needed.
